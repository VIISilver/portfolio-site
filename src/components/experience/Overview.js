                <h2>Work Experience Overview</h2>
                <p>Instead of writing a generic overview of every position I have ever worked I will give you a window into my character and how work has shaped who I am as a person.</p>
                <p>I began working at 14 as a sweeper for Bennion Elementary and learned the basics of work priorities. Being punctual, dividing work with co-workers, and accepting criticism. After a year as a sweeper I found a job working at Bestway trailer repair. I learned a lot about basic contruction and working with my hands. I worked at Bestway through High School and during my first year in College. No technical skills were developed during my time in either of these positions, but I did learn that working and taking pride in my work is critical to my confidence and self worth.</p>
                <p>During College I accepted a couple more positions where I was able to reinforce what I had learned at previous positions.&nbsp; I was referred by a friend to work at Nippon Express and obtained a position as a Customer Service Coordinator.&nbsp; It was at Nippon Express that I was able to really understand to power of computer programming.&nbsp; I was learning about Excel in one of my College courses and learned about logical functions and was incredibly interested in being able to automate a lot of work that was still being done by hand using 10 key calculators.&nbsp; It wasn't long before I reached the practical limits of using Microsoft Excel to automate monotoninous tasks.&nbsp; I moved to another position as an Accounting Intern at Clearlink and began learning Python in hopes of furthering my abilities to automate.</p>
