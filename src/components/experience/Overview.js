                <p>Instead of writing a generic overview of every position I have ever worked I will give you a window into my character and how work has shaped who I am as a person.</p>
                <p>I began working at 14 as a sweeper for Bennion Elementary and learned the basics of work priorities. Being punctual, dividing work with co-workers, and accepting criticism. After a year as a sweeper I found a job working at Bestway trailer repair. I learned a lot about basic contruction and working with my hands. I worked at Bestway through High School and during my first year in College. No technical skills were developed during my time in either of these positions, but I did learn that working and taking pride in my work is critical to my confidence and self worth.</p>
                <p>During College I accepted a couple more positions where I was able to reinforce what I had learned at previous positions.</p>
